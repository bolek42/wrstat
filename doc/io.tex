\section{/proc/diskstats}
    The file /proc/diskstats gives basic information on disk usage.
    It will give information on how many sectors read, written
    and time spent on IO for each device.
    This module consists only of the file diskstats.py .
    Even though the sectorsize is a hardcoded constant (512),
    this values are extracted from /sys/block/DEVICENAME/queue/hw\_sector\_size
    to avoid later unexpected issues.

\subsection{/proc/diskstats Created Files in Test Directory}
    For the graphs ( .svg files) the corresponding patterns are listed.
    This module will create the following files in the test directory.
    \begin{description}
        \item[samples/diskstats\_*]
            Snapshot of /proc/diskstats at the given time step.
        \item[diskstats-*.svg]
            Read and write acces for a specific device.
        \item[diskstats-*-time.svg]
            Graph that shows the time spent on reading or writing for a given device.
    \end{description}

\subsection{iostat}
    For debug reasons, there is also a module for iostat, which will handle
    /proc/diskstats and give basic IO throughput, but no further information.
    So this module is deprecated.
    This module will create the following files in the test directory.
    For the graphs ( .svg files) the corresponding patterns are listed.
    \begin{description}
        \item[samples/iostat]
            Output of iostat -d at the given interval.

        \item[iostat.pid]
            Contains the id of the running iostat process.
            This is only used to shut down iostat without using e.g. killall.

        \item[sectorsizes]
            Sectorsizes for all devices.

        \item[iostat-read.svg and iostat-write.svg]
            This graphs will show read or write access for all devices in comparison.

        \item[iostat-*.svg]
            Read and write acces for a specific device.
    \end{description}
