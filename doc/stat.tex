\section{/proc/stat}

\subsection{Description}
    /proc/stat gives basic information on the cpu usage. It measures the time
    that the CPU spent various states e.g. user mode, system, idle, virtual machine, etc.
    %\_SC\_CLK\_TCK
    It can be used to obtain a standard cpu usage graph.
    This module requires no further configuration and only consists of one file stat.py.

    %The most important values are the following:
    %\begin{description}
    %    \item[samples/stat\_*]
    %        Snapshot of /proc/stat at the given time step.

    %\end{description}
%\subsection{Wrstat Module} <- not needed
    %TODO

\subsection{Created Files in Test Directory}
    %This module creates per cpu and aggregated time series graphs, that 
    %showing the time the cpu spent e.g. in idle, system, user and various more modes.
    %There is also a graph, that shows the mean over time as a histogram
    %for comparison of each cpu.
    %description of modes?
    For the graphs ( .svg files) the corresponding patterns are listed.
    This module will create the following files in the test directory.
    \begin{description}
        \item[samples/stat\_*]
            Snapshot of /proc/stat at the given time step.

        \item[stat-cpu*.svg and stat-aggregated.svg]
            Per CPU and aggregated time series graphs.

        \item[stat-total.svg]
            Average histogram, that show the overall usage for all CPUs in comparison.
