Installation
	required:
		python-gnuplot
		oprofile

	1. copy the lockstat directory to your Installation path 
	2. link lockstat-run to e.g. /usr/local/bin
	3. modify the lockstat/lockstat.config

	Recompiling the kernel:
		dpkg -i
		grub-install /dev/vda ( optional?)
		reboot

Running tests:
	lockstat-run path/to/test/directory program arg1 arg2 ...

	While running a test, lockstat-sampling-deamon.py will create snapshots of all /proc files,
	given in lockstat.config at the given sample rate. If some files, does not exists,
	they will be ignored.
	After the program finished, the /proc files are parsed by lockstat.parser.py and dumped
	to samples.pickle, which is finally graphed by lockstat-graph.py

Test directory:
	This directory contains all test data and results including graphs.
	If the test direcotry does not exists it will be created,
	otherwise the results will been overwritten.

	Directory structure:
		test_dir
			lockstat.config			//snapshot of the lockstat.configf file
			cmd						//the actual command given to lockstat_run
			output					//stdout and stderr of cmd
			samples.pickle			//parsed samples. generated by lockstat-parser.py //FIXME
			samples/				//directory containing snapshots of procfiles
			*.svg					//multiple graphs generated by lockstat-graph.py
			oprofile_results		//the output of opreport
			oprofile_data			//the oprofile working directory
